# Graph Performance Comparison

This repo is related to the **Algorithm All-Hands Projects** (AAHP) described within the [Algorithmology.org](https://algorithmology.org/) curriculum.

This is the third AAHP within the Spring 2025 cohort of Algorithmology at [Allegheny College](https://sites.allegheny.edu/computer-science/) (CMPSC 202-00) taught by [Dr. Gregory M Kapfhammer](https://github.com/gkapfham).

## Algorithm All-Hands Projects

These projects enable students to explore both the scientific and engineering aspects of algorithm analysis, as outlined in the course schedule. During the completion of a scientific study phase of algorithm analysis, students will work in a team to propose an original research question and design an experiment to answer it. When completing an engineering effort phase of algorithm analysis, students work in a team as they design, implement, document, test, and maintain software tools that support the rigorous evaluation of the performance (e.g., time or space overhead) of a Python program. The conclusion of an algorithm all-hands project involves the team-based creation, publication, and oral presentation of a report that overviews all of the experiences during the completion of the scientific study and engineering effort tasks for answering an original research question in the field of algorithm analysis. Students may use external sources, including artificial intelligence coding assistants, during the completion of an algorithm all-hands project provided that they cite these sources and explain how they used them to complete their part(s) of an algorithm all-hands project.

## Project Description

### Research Question

How does implementing a graph with Pythonâ€™s `dict` of `set` vs. `list` impact performance in terms of insertion, deletion, and lookup speed?

### Evaluation Metrics

TODO: document evaluation metrics once decided upon

### Process

TODO: document experimental process

## Running the Experiment

In order to execute the code in this repo, a user must call the CLI function and pass in options.

### Command Options

TODO: include info on calling program

### Output

TODO: include sample output
